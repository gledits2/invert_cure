# Invertebrate Diversity CURE

Invertebrate diversity is an important aspect of many terrestrial environments. Given that the majority of the primary consumers of ecosystems tend to be primary consumers, a highly diverse community of invertebrates can support a highly diverse community of secondary and tertiary consumers. Therefore, by building our understanding of invertebrate diversity and what influences it, we can develop a more robust understanding of how changes in invertebrate diversity can cascade through a terrestrial ecosystem. This curriculum-based research experience (CURE) is designed to teach students about the importance of invertebrates to ecosystems and sampling design while adding to our understanding of their role in the environment.

This CURE is currently under development, so if you have suggestions or if something is unclear or does not work, please do not hesitate to reach out to us by creating a New Issue. Please stay tuned for further updates as we continue to develop this CURE and the research around it.

## Description

The Invertebrate Diversity CURE utilizes a trap, called a composite insect trap, first developed by [Russo *et al*. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021079). Russo and colleagues developed a trap that combines flight-interceptor, cone, and pan traps to collect the highest diversity of invertebrates possible without having to set out many kinds of traps. Further, the design that they developed can be built fairly easily at a minimal cost (about $77.50 per trap in 2011). Because of the ease of construction, students can build them depending on the time and goals of the course.

The composite insect trap can also be used in combination with other sampling techniques, such as beat nets, sweep nets, pitfall traps, and Berlese funnels, to show how different invertebrate species/communities occupy different niches and have different roles in the environment. See [Nageleisen and Bouget 2009](https://hal.science/hal-00539124v1) and/or [Yi *et al*. 2012](https://doi.org/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2012.02.010) for more information on the other kinds of insect collection techniques

## Files included

In this repository are a series of files ot help you implement the collection of invertebrates as a CURE for your course. These files include:

* A description of the traps primarily used
* A method of building the composite insect trap on a budget
* A method of building the composite insect trap that requires a 3D printer and additional materials, which seems to last longer but costs a little more to build
* STL files for the 3D printed parts of the trap
